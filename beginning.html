		<h1> Are You Screening ? </h1>
	
		<p>Movies can either be excellent, terrible or satisfactory. </p>

		<p>Most of the movies that I’ve watched are good. </p>
		
		<p>But, sometimes I’ve watched movies with awful endings. The movie could be really good, but for some of these movies, the ending is trash. </p>
		
		<p>When I watch these movies, I realize that it was a waste of my time and for the movies in the theatre, it's a waste of my money.</p>
		
		<p>This is why “Movie Scoop” is the right website for you. Here, I give my opinions about some of the newest/latest movies. </p>
	
		<p>DON'T WORRY! I also give my input about some tv shows as well. </p>
		
		<p>Stay tuned for every week as I will update the top three articles.</p>
