		<h3> About the Event :) </h3>
		
		<h4> By: Annjana </h4>
		
		<h6> September 27th, 2019</h6>
		
		<p> I'll be there for you (When the rain starts to pour) I'll be there for you (Like I've been there before) I'll be there for you ('Cause you're there for me too).This is the iconic song that will always remain in some people's hearts. For those who don’t know these lyrics, it is the theme song of the show Friends. The show Friends started on September 22, 1994, and stopped airing in 2004. Everyone has been talking about this event for the 25th anniversary. 	Originally it was going to be in the U.S but Canada also joined the trend as well. Cineplex announced that they were hosting the anniversary shows on September 22, 27 and 28th. In each show, they will be playing different episodes. As a Friends fan, I planned on going to see it. My friend and I, who are MASSIVE Friends fans, watched the show and had our opinions about it. </p>

		<h2> Before the Event </h2>
		
		<p>Let me tell you what happened before we watched the show. I’ve got to say that it was one heck of a time. We both went to watch the film in Markham VIP.	Me and my friend, Swei, bought the tickets online and thought that it was going to be played in a regular theatre. Along with us, my dad joined.When we showed the tickets to the ticket keeper, he told us that we weren’t allowed to go because we were under 19.	He told us to return our tickets so that we could get our money back. At that very moment, you should have seen the faces of my friend and I. We both were surprised and heart-broken. We both had been WAITING for this event for so long. Suddenly the manager, our saviour, came and let us go through.He knew that this was a pretty special event that was once in a lifetime. He took us to the VIP section and at that moment, we all were surprised.	We got to realize that the show was in the VIP section. We were so blind to the details on the ticket, which said “VIP 19+”. From there we sat on those comfortable couches and the event began! </p>

		<h2> My Opinion </h2>
		
		<p> The event consisted of 4 20 minute episodes that were in the 10 seasons.The event started at 12 and ended at 1:30. We watched “The One With The Prom Video”, “The One Where No One's Ready”, “The One With The Morning After” and “The One With The Embryos”. Whese episodes were pretty good and we enjoyed watching them. We laughed for quite a while and felt like the episodes were finishing quickly. In the end, we were pretty sad that it finished but overall, it was super fun. However, we had some suggestions that we thought would have made the event better.	We liked the episodes they chose but felt it would be more meaningful and would have be a nice ending to the event if they included the last two episodes of season 10.These episodes especially touched our hearts (and make us shed a tear).We also thought that they should have repeated the same episodes for each event as we felt that the time we went they didn't play episodes that were as good as the ones played in other dates. Also finally, we would have enjoyed it if there were some behind the scences and bloopers.</p> 
				
		<p>If I were, to be honest, it was kind of a waste of money. You could have done the same thing at home and didn’t need to spend about 40 dollars.	So, it wasn’t worth the watch. Sorry :( </p>
