		<h1 id= "Top">Bird Box: Does it live up to its hype? </h1>
		<h3> By: Annjana </h3>
		<h6> December,15th, 2018 </h6>
	
		<p> Recently, the only thing that I’ve been hearing about is the movie “Bird Box” Some people have been hyping this movie up while others say it’s just a waste of time. With all these mixed opinions, I wanted to answer the question with a final answer. I wanted see if it was actually worth the watch Bird Box, which is based off the book, stars Gravity’s Sandra Bullock, Moonlight’s Trevante Rhodes, Ocean’s Eight’s Sarah Paulson, John Malkovich and Machine Gun Kelly. The movie falls under the genre of Thriller and Horror. The movie is about how when a person sees this force, an entity that takes the form of people’s worst fears, it causes them to commit suicide.The population kept decreasing as the more that witness it, die. A woman and her children try to find hope. They travel to a safe place but through everything, they cannot see.</p>

		<h5> *Note: Beyond this point, some parts of the movies, Bird Box and A Quiet Place, will get revealed. </h5>
	
		<h2> Opinions </h2>
	
		<p>To see if this movie lived up to its name, I had to go watch it and check it out for myself. In my opinion, I believe that the movie was worth the watch. Even though at some parts I was frightened, I enjoyed the suspense.  
		The acting in the film was amazing and you can see how in-character they were.  Through everything, I believe that the ending was the best.
		When Malorie named the girl and boy, Olympia and Tom, it was cute and a nice way to end the plot.
		There was no part during the film where I thought that the movie was boring. Almost in every scene, there was something that was interesting.
		To be honest, I thought that there was nothing in this movie that I would take out because all the parts make the movie the way it is. 
		I believe that it isn’t a waste of time watching this. However, many other people have opinions that are negative on this movie. 
		Internet user, Kailey Deemer, wrote “This movie was honestly a way for Netflix to make a quick buck.
		They saw John Krasinski’s amazing work for A Quiet Place and copy and pasted the plot. They added terrible actors, the dialog that was written by a five year old, and way to many moments that I think were meant to pull at your heart stings but didn’t work out as they had planned.” 
		I don’t agree with what they said but I agree with what user Sasha Hammond had to say, “I’m really surprised at the lack of great reviews for this one. I thought it was far more suspenseful, interesting, and heart wrenching than A Quiet Place”</p>
		
		<h2> Bird Box vs. The Quiet Place </h2>
		
		<p>There are many misconceptions that Bird Box was quite similar to the movie “A Quiet Place” People say that the only difference in Bird Box is that instead of speaking, you can’t see.  
		Both stories share the fact that human beings have to adapt and survive in their dystopian world.
		They both focus of one family and how they are able to live. According to ” — Tad Desai (@taddesai94) on Twitter, “Bird Box is such a blatant rip-off of A Quiet Place and it makes me irrationally upset”
		However, people who have read the book have said that technically A Quiet Place copied Bird Box. 
		The book for Bird Box was first released in U.S on May, 13th, 2014.  It was released before A Quiet Place was made. Twitter user Daya Ryelle (@dayaryelle) tweeted “Movie Buffs: Bird Box is a rip-off of A Quiet Place. 
		Bookworms: You know the book BB (Bird Box)is adapted from came out in 2013, right?” Therefore, we can just say that they both are different films which both are about trying to survive.</p>

		<h2> New Trends From The Movie </h2>
			
			<p>Due to some people’s passionate interest in this movie, a challenge called “The Bird Box Challenge” started. 
			The challenge is to do what you normally do with a blindfold on. Multiple people have been doing this challenge. 
			Some people have been doing simple task with their blindfolds while others have done mundane and dangerous stunts.
			An example would be the incident that happened on Saturday, January 12th. A teen from Utah died as they were trying to do the Bird Box Challenge while driving a car. Even before such incident, Netflix has announced that everyone should stop trying to do the challenge.
			&quot;Can&#39;t believe I have to say this, but: PLEASE DO NOT HURT YOURSELVES WITH THIS BIRD BOX CHALLENGE. We don&#39;t know how this started, and we appreciate the love,&quot; Netflix tweeted to its users on Wednesday. 
			Also, the movie Bird Box has become a meme. Many people have been making captions to pictures used in the film. Both, the memes and the challenge, have been an internet sensation recently. </p>
